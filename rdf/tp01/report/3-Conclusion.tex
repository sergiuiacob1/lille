\paragraph{}
We have managed to use the \emph{moments of a shape} in order to define \emph{shape attributes}.
Having these, we now know information such as the \emph{surface} of a shape, the \emph{barycenter} of the shape, what its \emph{main axis of inertia} is and how much ``inertia'' exists on each of these axis, thanks to the \emph{eigen values} calculated from $I$, the \emph{inertia matrix}.
Being able to make these invariant to the translation, rotation and scale of a shape is also a big advantage and should serve us well in the future.
