Our initial goal was to draw conclusion about points, about their $x$ and $y$ values and to classify them as well as possible, having as comparison the true labels.
By using the covariance, LDA and QDA, we managed to do just that.
We saw that LDA does a good job classifying the points, overall, but QDA introduced a notion of generality (the curved decision lines) that increased our algorithm's accuracy.
