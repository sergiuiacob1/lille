By using methods such as Principal Component Analysis and Factorial Discriminant Analysis, we were successfully in reducing our number of features.
We have seen that applying this pre-processing negatively impacts our accuracy (for our case), but it also simplifies the visualisation of data.
The most important thing is that we managed to reach our most important goal: find the most discriminant axis for our points, using each method, then projecting our points on that axis.
