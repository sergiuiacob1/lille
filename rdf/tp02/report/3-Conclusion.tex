\paragraph{}
Taking advantage of the methods presented in this report, one is now able to code and decode a shape's contour with ease.
Shapes that resemble a sequence of concatenated segments can be drastically simplified with the Chord algorithm and irregular shapes can be ``smoothened'' using the Fourier method.
Nevertheless, both methods can be used to simplify the shapes in some way.
\paragraph{}
We may even state that we're able to do some kind of ``shape compression'', for example by only saving the non-zero Fourier descriptors (for the first method), and only the points resulted from the Chord algorithm (for the second one).
We can further take advantage of the parametrisation of the methods (i.e. \emph{ratio} and $d_{max}$) to best suit our needs.
In conclusion, these allow us to now work with a shape's contour.
