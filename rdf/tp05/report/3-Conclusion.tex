Bayes' theorem relieves us from having to manually search for the best threshold.
It provided results close to what we were looking for, with low error rates.
It can be used in a multitude of scenarios as a strong classification tool, this report presenting just one simple example.

However, when segmenting the digits, for example, we did rely on already existing perfect segmentations in order to calculate probabilities like $P(w)$.
Without those, Bayes' theorem could not have been applied.
This is, however, a step in the right direction, especially coming from a method where we were manually selecting the threshold based on the histograms of gray values.
