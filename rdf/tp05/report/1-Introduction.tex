\section{Context}
\paragraph{}
This report is the result of a university assignment.
It aims to prove that the student understood the motivation, goals and means of studying pattern recognition.
Therefore, this is a way of summarizing a series of observations and experiments done on images containing shapes.

\section{Motivation}
\paragraph{}
In order to be able to work with shapes, we must first acquire them.
Most of the time, they are not given to us in their simplest form, but found in images with all kinds of backgrounds.
They must be extracted as precisely as possible, making sure we differentiate them from the background as accurately as we can.

\section{Goals}
\paragraph{}
We'll try to apply \emph{binary segmentation} to a series of gray images.
Our goal is to find an automatic method of doing this and identify objects and backgrounds, mainly focusing on the histograms of gray values.
