Using only the gray values or the texture values as attributes did not result in a great segmentation.
As we've seen in the experiments, the error rate, when using each attribute individually, can be pretty high in certain cases, even though for some textures the methods are really precise.

However, where one of them did bad, the other did well. By combining the two, we have a much more precise way of segmenting the image.
In conclusion, we may state that the combination of the two attributes is a worthy contender for binary segmentation.
